# Frontend Development Guide

* Frontend codebase provided by the client.
* Development of Monthlog/AI-assistant FE web features will proceed based on the specifications and structure defined here.
* This project is part of the Monthler platform and built with Next.js 14 (App Router).

fyi. The development team must create `develop` branch and commit the result into develop.

---

## 1. Overview

Monthlog
* Goal: Community archive where users contribute and share city information (cost of living, safety, culture, etc.)

AI Assistant
* Goal: AI-powered personalized travel subsidy recommendations and planning

FE Team’s Roles & Responsibilities (R&R)
  * Develop the UI and API integration based on the provided prototype.
  * Implement responsive web development. Since the prototype is not fully responsive, use it as the UI reference but adjust the CSS to ensure proper responsiveness.
  * Remove or modify animations from the prototype if they cause performance degradation.

**Conclusion:**
Use the prototype as the codebase for UI creation, but the FE development team will handle performance optimization, responsive adjustments, and actual API integration.

## 2. Tech Stack
* Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
* Language: TypeScript
* Styling: Tailwind CSS
* Deployment: dev / prod environments
  * Environments are separated into **dev** and **prod**
  * This repository contains only a **partial codebase extracted from the client’s main repository**
  * **Merging and deployment to the original repository is managed by the client team**
* Authentication: JWT-based
  * **Access control for pages and APIs will be discussed further to decide whether it is handled by the client or the development team**

## 3. Project Structure

```
/app            # Next.js App Router pages
  /monthlog     # Root directory of Monthlog pages developed by FE dev team
  /monthlog-proto # Root directory of Monthlog prototype pages provided by the client. DO NOT EDIT this file directly.

  /assi-ai      # Root directory of AI assistant pages developed by FE dev team
  /assi-ai-proto  # Root directory of AI assistant prototype pages provided by the client. DO NOT EDIT this file directly.

/components     # Reusable UI components
  /monthlog     # Root directory of Monthlog component developed by FE dev team
  /monthlog-proto # Root directory of prototype component of Monthlog provided by the client. DO NOT EDIT this file directly.
  /assi-ai      # Root directory of AI assistant component developed by FE dev team
  /assi-ai-proto # Root directory of prototype component of AI assistant provided by the client. DO NOT EDIT this file directly.
/types          # TypeScript interfaces
/lib            # Shared business logic and utility functions (API handlers, formatters, etc.)
  api-handler.tsx # pre-defined axios module

Note:
The goal of this project is to develop Monthlog/AI assistant FE web.
The development team must define clear directory rules for these features and implement them consistently within their designated folders.
The dev team can keep the component names and page routing URLs the same as in the prototype, but do **not modify the prototype itself**.
Instead, create and develop/modify separate pages or components under the defined directory(/monthlog, /assi-ai).

```

## 4. Styling Guidelines

* Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
* Implement responsive CSS for both web and mobile views
* Define and apply consistent class names for shared components (e.g., buttons) so that styles can be updated in one place later by the client

---

## 5. FE Code Convention

* **Only English is allowed for comments (Vietnamese comments are strictly prohibited).**
* Frontend components should be separated and named using lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `form-btn.tsx`).
* Follow the routing structure provided in the reference diagram.

Example:
```
app
 ├── monthlog
 │     └── recommend/page.tsx   → URL: /monthlog/recommend
```
